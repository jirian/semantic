# Step-indexed Kripke worlds for a higher-order mutable store

This module defines `kdenot`, a step-indexed value relation for a higher-order mutable
store, over a store typing (`StoreTyping`) that assigns each cell a monotone value relation.
Its cell relation exposes the cell agreement only as a one-way implication (`R → val Tc`),
which suffices for `read`/`alloc` but not for `write` (which needs the backward direction).
The world-parametrized store in `Denotation/StepIndexedWorldParam.lean`, used by
`Denotation/Core.lean`, supplies both directions via a biconditional cell agreement.

## The problem

A generic cell `cell cs T` stores a heap *location* whose content must be a
`T`-value.  With a higher-order store, the predicate "`l`'s content is a `T`-value" is
not monotone under the naive future relation `Memory.subsumes` (a `write` changes the
content), and a faithful `read` (returning the content reference) cannot be replayed in
a subsuming memory.  This is the classical obstacle to a *monotone* logical relation
over an ML-style mutable store.

## Why a store typing alone is not enough (first-order vs. higher-order)

A **world** is a pair `(st, m)` with a *store typing* `st : Nat → Option (Ty .capt {})`
assigning a closed type to each mutable cell, and `MemTyped st m` ("every live cell's
content respects `st`").  The cell value relation records `st l = some T` (a *persistent*
fact) instead of pinning the content; this is what makes it monotone, and reading
recovers the content's type from `MemTyped`.

Making the value relation recurse *structurally on the type*, with no step-indexing, is
sound only for the reference fragment, because a **function** value's relation must quantify over
future worlds and require them well-typed (`MemTyped`) — and `MemTyped` calls the value
relation at *arbitrary* cell-content types (cells may store functions, cells-of-cells,
…).  So `val(arrow) → MemTyped → val(arbitrary content type)` has no well-founded
measure on the type: the classical higher-order-store obstruction.

## The construction (`kdenot`)

`kdenot` adds a **step index** `k` ("well-typed for `k` more observation steps"): the
function case at index `k+1` quantifies over future worlds that are `MemTyped` at index `k`
and its body recurses at index `k`, so every recursive call decrements `k` (no recursion on
the *type* at the same index) and the definition is well-founded.  This breaks the
well-foundedness obstruction and supports `read`/`alloc`; it validates — on the real
`Ty`/`Memory` — monotonicity along `WorldLe` (free by transitivity for the function case),
downward closure in `k`, and that `read`/`alloc`/`write` read off / maintain the world's
well-typing.

Its *cell* relation exposes only a one-way implication, so it does NOT support `write` (see
the header): the biconditional cell agreement of the world-parametrized store supplies that.
Capture-set coverage is omitted (orthogonal and already monotone).

/-- A **monotone** value relation: a memory-expression predicate stable under memory
growth (`subsumes`).  Every relation we ever store is a `val_denot` instance, hence
monotone (`val_denot_is_monotonic`); bundling the monotonicity proof with the relation
lets `MemTyped` be preserved under `subsumes` (`memTyped_subsumes`) and frees `alloc`/
`write` from an external `hmono` premise — without exposing the relation's origin. -/

theorem WorldLe.refl (st : StoreTyping) (m : Memory) : WorldLe st m st m :=
  ⟨Memory.subsumes_refl m, fun _ _ h => h⟩

/-- **The step-indexed value relation.**

Recursion is well-founded on the index `k`.  Base types and `cell`/`reader` consult only
the store typing `st` (never the content) — that is what keeps the cell relation
monotone — and do not recurse.  The `arrow` case quantifies over a *strictly smaller*
index `j < k` and over future worlds that are well-typed at `j` (the `MemTyped j` premise
inlined as the big `∀ l Tc n …`); its body recurses at `j`.  Every recursive call is at
`j < k`, so the definition is well-founded by recursion on `k`, and the `∀ j < k` shape
makes downward closure in the index free (`kdenot_down`).

NB (foundation stand-in): the real function *result* type `T2 : Ty .exi (∅,x)` is
existential and may mention the argument, so its denotation is `exi_exp_denot` of the
*opened* type — orthogonal machinery.  Here the codomain is modeled by the (closed)
domain type `T1` at a further future world, which is exactly the right shape to validate
the index-drop and the transitivity-based monotonicity; `Denotation/Core.lean`'s value
relation uses the real `exi_exp_denot k` codomain. -/
